Denver Service Request Events

**The Project**

**Preface**

For test delivery, the data set here is relatively small (data from
Denver\'s open data catalog (https://www.denvergov.org/opendata)). You
should approach this test as though the data were 1000x the actual size
and frequently updated by real-time events.

**Approach**

There might be multiple ways to approach this challenge but the approach
which is being used here is AWS Cloud by building out the core of system
with components like EC2, Kinesis Data Firehose, S3, Glue, Athena,
Redshift, Quicksight, Kinesis Data Streams, Lambda, DynamoDB.


**Data Pipeline**

**The Data Flow:**

-   Kinesis Data Firehose -- To capture data from events being generated
    on Amazon EC2 instance which will be monitored by Kinesis Agent.

-   S3 -- Publish the events coming from Kinesis Data Firehouse into a
    data lake house in S3 which can be used in many different ways

-   AWS Glue -- To infer a schema from the data lake in S3 which houses
    all the data. Glue Crawler will scan the data seating there in S3
    and will populate the Glue Data Catalog.

-   Amazon Athena -- Issue queries against that data from Athena as if
    it were a SQL Database.

-   Amazon Redshift -- For building out Data Warehousing, have used
    Redshift Spectrum here to access the data in S3. The advantage is if
    we had other tables that were loaded in Redshift, we can join that
    data with S3 data as well.

-   Amazon Quicksight -- Building out Data Visualization, spin up the
    Amazon Quicksight to visualize the data coming from Redshift which
    in turn is looking at the data in S3.

-   Kinesis Data Streams -- Capture the events which gets generated on
    Amazon EC2 instance.

-   AWS Lambda -- Publish the data coming from Kinesis Data Streams to
    AWS Lambda Function.

-   DynamoDB -- The Lambda function which gets invoked will turn around
    and populate the data into DynamoDB if needed in future client app
    can read from.
